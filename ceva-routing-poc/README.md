# CEVA Dynamic Routing & Logistics Intelligence POC

A web-based dynamic routing & logistics-intelligence platform for last-mile delivery, branded for CEVA Logistics France. The POC demonstrates four differentiated capabilities on a synthetic France / Île-de-France dataset anchored at the Roissy-CDG hub:

1. **Dynamic Route Optimization** — Google OR-Tools VRP with capacity, time-windows, max-stops, soft-drop penalties and a **carbon-aware multi-objective cost** (`distance × per-km cost + CO₂e × €90/tonne`).
2. **Fleet & Asset Utilization Analytics** — load %, time %, stop %, idle vehicles, drop rate, cost per delivery / km / kg.
3. **Carbon Footprint Tracking & Sustainability Scoring** — total CO₂e, per-delivery, per-km, per-kg; baseline vs optimized savings; equivalencies (trees, car-km); EV vs diesel split; Green Score per route (0–100).
4. **AI Logistics Co-Pilot** — Mistral AI (`mistral-large-latest` by default, configurable) with **streaming** responses, RAG Pipeline Engineering context, and the current routes/utilization/carbon/financial state injected as context. Falls back to a deterministic data-grounded answer if no API key is set, so the demo always works.

All wrapped in a **CEVA-branded analytics dashboard** (red `#98012E`, navy `#0B2C5C`, Inter font, clean industrial styling) aligned to a France control-tower use case.

## Quick start (3 commands)

### Option A — Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env       # add MISTRAL_API_KEY (optional)
docker-compose up --build
# open http://localhost:5173
```

### Option B — local

```bash
cp .env.example .env
./run.sh
# open http://localhost:5173
```

The first run generates `data/depot.json`, `data/vehicles.json`, `data/synthetic_orders.json`. Re-create with `python backend/data_generator.py --regenerate`.

> **No Mistral key?** The Co-Pilot still works — `llm.py` falls back to a deterministic, data-grounded responder that cites real numbers from the current scenario.

## 5-minute demo script

1. **Load** — open http://localhost:5173. Initial `/api/data → /api/baseline → /api/optimize` runs automatically. KPIs populate in seconds.
2. **Run Optimization** — click the red CTA. The "Optimized" scenario should show lower distance, cost and CO₂ vs Baseline (the deltas turn green-↓ on the KPI strip).
3. **Carbon tab** — review "X kg CO₂ saved today", trees & car-km equivalencies, EV vs diesel donut, Green Score gauge.
4. **Disruption** — pick "Vehicle Breakdown" → Inject. The fleet drops a truck and re-optimizes; orders get reshuffled, KPIs update.
5. **Co-Pilot** — click the floating "AI" button. Try the chips:
   - "Summarize today's optimization wins"
   - "Which vehicles are underutilized?"
   - "How much CO₂ did we save and what's the equivalent?"
   The response streams in and lists the cited KPIs at the bottom.
6. **Route detail** — click any vehicle on the map or in the Utilization tab to open the slide-in drawer showing stops, ETAs, cumulative-load curve, CO₂, cost and Green Score.

## API surface

| Method | Path                | Purpose                                           |

| GET    | `/api/analytics`    | consolidated KPI + utilization + carbon + financial + service |

| POST   | `/api/chat`         | Mistral streaming SSE with state context injected |
| POST   | `/api/reset`        | restore the original orders + vehicles            |

## Architecture and AI governance updates

The current implementation remains incremental and preserves the existing `/api/*` contracts. The new `/api/architecture` endpoint and dashboard tab expose:

- **Phase 1 assessment** — optimization latency, in-memory state, matrix rebuild cost, AI responsibility boundaries, and security configuration gaps.
- **Phase 2 target architecture** — React control tower, FastAPI orchestration, OR-Tools optimization service, OSRM/Google routing adapter, Mistral intelligence service, and PostgreSQL operational store.
- **Selected item from the reference image** — **RAG Pipeline Engineering**. Mistral receives retrieval-style operational context (current KPIs, routes, SLA risk, carbon metrics, and France playbook) to reason over; it does not replace OR-Tools.
- **Responsibility boundary** — OR-Tools handles VRP solving, scheduling, time windows, and capacity constraints. Mistral handles operational reasoning, dispatch recommendations, exception handling, natural-language interpretation, and workflow orchestration only.

## Carbon model

Defined in `backend/carbon.py`:

| Vehicle      | g CO₂e/km       |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| small_van    | 210 (diesel LCV, France urban duty cycle) |
| medium_truck | 520 (diesel MCV / rigid truck) |
| ev           | 20 (France low-carbon grid planning factor) |

Equivalencies use 21 kg CO₂/yr per mature tree and 120 g/km for an average passenger car planning factor. The optimizer prices carbon at **€90/tonne** so route choices reflect both euro and emission costs.

## Phase 2 roadmap

- **Real TMS integration** — pull live orders/SKUs from CEVA's TMS instead of synthetic data; push optimized stops back as dispatch plans.
- **Telematics ingest** — replace static cost/CO₂ factors with measured per-vehicle telematics (fuel burn, kWh, idling, harsh braking).
- **Multi-depot** — graph-based depot selection + inter-depot transfers; per-depot dashboards aggregated to a regional view.
- **Driver mobile app** — ETA confirmations, proof of delivery, real-time re-routing pushed from the optimizer.
- **Predictive disruption** — combine traffic API + weather + historical SLAs to pre-empt re-optimization before delays hit.
- **What-if simulator** — extend the Co-Pilot to run in-process scenarios ("convert V-201 to EV", "add a 9th vehicle") via tool-use.

---

## Limitations & assumptions

- OR-Tools time limit is **8 s**; production deployments should tune this and warm-start from previous solutions.
- OSRM public demo is rate-limited; for production use a self-hosted OSRM or commercial routing API. The Haversine fallback is automatic but less accurate.
- Carbon emission factors are well-to-wheel approximations (France grid planning factor) — should be calibrated against CEVA's measured fleet data.
- ROI extrapolation assumes uniform performance across 10 France regional depots and 312 working days — meant as an order-of-magnitude figure for executives, not a forecast.
- The deterministic fallback in `llm.py` is intentionally simple; with `MISTRAL_API_KEY` set, full reasoning quality is delegated to `mistral-large-latest` by default.
- All data is synthetic and seeded with `42`; no real customer / driver / address data is used.
